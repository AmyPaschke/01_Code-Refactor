# Code Refactor
The client requested an update to both their website and code to include web accessibility. 

## Motivation
* This project added web accessibility to all images and created an easier document for future front-end developers to read
* Change the HTML <div> tags to semantic tags
* To rearrange all elements to follow a more logical structure
* Update the title element to a more logical string
